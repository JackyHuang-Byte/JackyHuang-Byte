# 👋 Hi, I'm Jacky

🎮 I'm a self-motivated learner, building a programming foundation through hands-on practice and iterative development.  
🌱 I'm currently focused on C# and Unity to understand core programming concepts, architecture, and interactive systems.  
🧠 I'm interested in practical software development, from simple UI flows to small productivity or logic-based tools.  
🔧 I'm using GitHub to manage projects, document learning, and stay consistent in improving code structure and workflow.
